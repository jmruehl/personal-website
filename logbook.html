                    <p>So this is my first website. I'm currently learning coding with a course on the amazing Scrimba plattform. 
                        Today I am proud of my achievements and the effort I put into learning to code. 
                        See this website as the starting point of my journey. Find a description of start of this project at 
                        <a href="portfolio.html#personal-website" class="">my portfolio site</a>.

                    <p>As a result of the Scrimba challenge this side had a few great looking buttons with no function at all. 
                        So I added some JavaScript code to make them work.
                        <button class="display-text">continue reading</button>
                    </p>
                    <p class="hidden">In addition each log book entry hides a part of the text when loading and can be displayed 
                        when clicking 'continue reading'. The button is coded to disappear when clicked.

                    <p>Yesterday I came up with the idea to label this subpage as 'Log Book' instead of 'Articles'. I assume that this 
                        goes with me living close to the harbour and water. Today I will start using this log book to define my goals for a day,
                        note my coding learnings and progress.
                        <button class="display-text">continue reading</button>
                    </p>
                    <p class="hidden">My plans for today: Rework the layout of the log book. I also want to 
                        spend some time on the content, meaning writing more entries to my log book and rework the existing ones. 
                        And finally I plan to implement a function to display the most recent log book entry 
                        (instead of using static HTML) and to update automatically when I write a new entry.</p>

                    <p>Today I want to dive deeper into JavaScript and finish the tasks I started yesterday. 
                        I will spend some time on coding this website and will then continue the Scrimba course.

                     <p class="hidden"> Yesterday I created a first version of the portfolio page. 
                         Now time to create content to this page aka create more projects. :) 
                         I can now display the most-recent log book entry also on top of the page. 
                         Unfortunately the button is not working yet as this button is not in the HTML but in the JavaScript-file 
                         the EventListener I added to the other buttons isn't working here. I will have to fix this issue.

                    <p>Today I want to further improve my knowledge of Javscript. Therefore I will continue

                        This module includes some challenges and I'm looking forward to code a project for my own portfolio, too. 
                        Stay tuned for the first entry on my portfolio page soon!

                    <p class="small-text">Written by <span class="accent-text">Merle</span> on <time datetime="2021-07-19" class="accent-text">July 19, 2021</time></p>
                    <p>During the weekend I studied Module 3 'Making websites interactive' of <a href="https://scrimba.com/learn/frontend">the Scrimba Course</a>. 
                        The Module contains 166 videos with a total lenght of 8 hours. In general videos - so called scrims - vary from less than a 
                        minute to a few minutes and they are rarely more than 6 minutes long.  
                        <button class="display-text">continue reading</button>
                    </p> 
                     <p class="hidden"> Each video contains a specific topic and a task to code by yourself. And here the great advantage of the 
                        Scrimba Editor comes into play. You can stop the scrim at any time and the video turns into an editor with the full code avaiable. 
                        So at any given moment you can actually code yourself and even save your that code to a note. Isn't that a great way to learn?!

                    <p class="small-text">Written by <span class="accent-text">Merle</span> on <time datetime="2021-07-20" class="accent-text">July 20, 2021</time></p>
                    <p>Today I want to improve the details of my website. At the moment a few 'Lorem Ipsum' texts are remaining that I want to 
                        replace. Additionally I will also improve the first entry on my portfolio sub page about this project. 
                        <button class="display-text">continue reading</button>
                    </p>
                    <p class="hidden">Yesterday I had a closer look at the non-working button in the 'most-recent entry' at the top of my log book.
                        I actually just needed to change some lines of code in the Logbook-JavaScript-File, so that I first create this section and 
                        afterwards add an Event Listener to all the buttons, including the one of this section. And now its working! Yey!
                        It's amazing how simple solutions in coding can be. I didn't had to write new code or add anything to make that button work. 
                        It was as simple as running the code in another order.
